Ideal for detecting dead code, finding duplicated logic (clones), exposing scaffolding artifacts (TODOs, Phase N comments, placeholders), and analyzing call graphs. Provides code graph analysis to trace function connections and understand blast radius before refactoring. Supports 15 languages including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, and more. Use when traditional linters miss the mess that accumulates when AI writes most of the code."
