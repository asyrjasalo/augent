# Augent

Augments AI coding agents (such as OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) with resources (such as skills, subagents, commands, rules and MCP servers) in a lean, reproducible, and intuitive manner.

It:
- Stores bundles of resources as Git repositories and directories.
- Implements locking to ensure 100% reproducibility across your team.
- Frees you from burden of converting between AI agent specific formats.

It does NOT:
- Rely on a centralized package registry.
- Require a PhD in dependency management.
- Cargo cult existing package managers.
